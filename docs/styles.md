# Styling

Below are the styles for user facing pages. Note that these are influenced by Bulma.

## Headings

Headings should use the `subtitle` and `is-1` classes along with the `h1` tag. The only exception to this is the home
page. That page uses the `title` and `is-1` classes.

## Page Titles

All pages need to provide a title `<% provide :title, "Home" %>`

## Buttons

All buttons should use the `button` and `is-primary` classes.
